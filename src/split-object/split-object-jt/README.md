# Split-Object: .

Split an object into an array of objects.
Each entry in the array will be one key/value pair from the object.

```js
/**
 * Splits an object into multiple objects with one key/value pair each.
 * The new objects are returned in an array.
 *
 * This function has no side-effects, the argument object is not modified
 *
 * @param {Object} [toSeparate={}] - The object to split into key/value pairs.
 * @returns {Array} Returns a new array with one entry for each key/value pair.
 * @example
 *
 * splitObject({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
 * // -> [{ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }, { c: 3 }]
 *
 * @example
 *
 * splitObject({ name: 'robs', age: 25, tall: true, userName: 'sbor' });
 * // -> [{ name: 'robs }, { age: 25 }, { tall: true }, { userName: 'sbor' }]
 *
 * @example
 *
 * splitObject({});
 * // -> []
 */
```

## Strategy

1. Create a new empty array to store the objects key/value pairs.
2. Loop for iterating the keys of the argument object.
3. Push the key values(key/value) as an object into the newArray.

## Implementation

- for of -

- Object.keys() -
- .push()

## Use Cases

const

console.log(copiaArrayObj)
